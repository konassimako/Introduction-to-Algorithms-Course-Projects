# Introduction-to-Algorithms-Course-Projects
This repository contains all the projects developed within the course of the subject Introduction to Algorithms

------The Max-Sub-Array project:

This code, given a matrix of random integers between -10 and 10, aims to find the sub-matrix with the largest total value sum and then 
calculate that sum. Three different algorithms, of different complexity, are used and the execution time of each algotirthm is measured.

-----The Sparse-Matrix project:

This code simulates the airport grid of Europe. Initially 1000 airports are randomly created and assigned at different places in the grid.
Then we randomly create 10000 air connenctions and these connections are stored in a sparse matrix. In the end we aim to find the closest 
airport connection for all the airports.

-----The Hash Table Project:

This project simulates an online shop. We have some random purchases, from different credit cards and of different cost values. We dynamically store all the purchase information in a Hash Table. In the end, we aim to find which credit card number spent the largest amount of money and which one visited the online shop the most.
